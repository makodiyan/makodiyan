## Hi, I’m Manu Kodiyan 👋

I’m a software architect and applied ML engineer focused on
**document AI, spreadsheet understanding, and enterprise-scale data systems**.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning research,  production-grade systems, real-world B2B Information Extraction workflows (Excel, PDFs, Word, images)

---

### Current Focus

- **Document AI for structured business data**  
  Designing end-to-end pipelines that combine LLMs, deep learning and statistical ML for IE
- **TableSense2** — an open-source, Excel-native table detection framework Modernizing spreadsheet understanding using ConvNeXt V2 + DETR-style models. This work is inspired by the [TableSense paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13500).
